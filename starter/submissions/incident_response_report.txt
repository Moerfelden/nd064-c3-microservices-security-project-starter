1. Incident commander name:
   Magnus Rothe

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
   The attacker managed to run crypto miners on our system, which is undesirable.
   Three pods were created in our Kubernetes cluster, each running a different cryptocurrency mining application (Monero CPU miner pool, Minergate, and CryptoNight).

3. Summary of what was affected:
   The Kubernetes cluster was affected: the attacker was able to get control of the Kubernetes cluster and execute the pods with kubectl. 
   They either have access to an administrative terminal and the kubeconfig file, or maybe they have taken over the UI.

4. Summary of the impact:
   Each of these pods will consume resources (CPU and memory) on the nodes in our Kubernetes cluster, as they are designed to perform crypto-mining operations.
   Increased CPU and memory utilization results in higher costs while simultaneously degrading the performance and stability of the entire cluster. 
   Additionally, the presence of crypto miners expands the attack surface due to their inherent security vulnerabilities.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
   The administrator noticed the event through Grafana monitoring and evicted the crypto mining pods.
   Once the pods have been evicted, CPU utilization begins to decrease, and no additional alerts related to crypto mining are triggered.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
   Attackers are after compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining. Hence, we should review access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals. 
   Admission controllers can be configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers.
   It is also good to have monitoring like the dashboards we use. Falco generates security  alerts in Grafana for events like this.
